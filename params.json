I decide against releasing this on the App Store and instead decided to open source it so that anyone can make improvements, use it on their own device, or use it to make something even better.\r\n\r\nI think we can all benefit from having a little less of The Donald in our lives.\r\n\r\nFor more read my post about it [here](https://medium.com/@alexcmeyer/an-experiment-of-sorts-can-you-remove-trump-from-the-internet-d8647cefe340#.4zaelyemm)\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\nTo use or check the app out, you need to follow these simple steps:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n2. Open the project with Xcode.\r\n3. Run the app on your iPhone or the iOS Simulator.\r\n4. You're all set! Make sure to enable the content blocker in iOS Settings > Safari > Content Blockers\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis project is written in Swift 2.0 and uses the content blocking extension which requires Xcode 7 to build and run.\r\n\r\nIt is compatible with iOS 9+ and iOS devices running arm64.\r\n\r\n## Created by\r\n\r\n[Alex Meyer](http://twitter.com/alexcmeyer)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the MIT License: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
